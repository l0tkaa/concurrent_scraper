# Advanced Web Scraping Application

**Project Description:**

This is a high-performance web scraping application designed to efficiently gather data from websites while ensuring compliance with web scraping best practices. The application leverages multithreading and multiprocessing to scrape large datasets quickly and processes data in parallel for maximum efficiency. It integrates rate limiting, proxy management, and session handling to avoid detection and blockages, ensuring smooth and responsible scraping.

In addition to its powerful scraping capabilities, this app automatically checks and follows `robots.txt` rules to avoid restricted sections of websites, ensuring that scraping is legal and ethical. Designed with modularity in mind, it is easy to extend and customize with new features.

### Features
- **Multithreading**: Scrape multiple URLs simultaneously for faster data collection.
- **Multiprocessing**: Process scraped data in parallel to reduce bottlenecks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Ensure compliance with web scraping policies to prevent overloading servers.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Use different proxies to avoid getting blocked by websites.
- **Session Management**: Handle cookies and headers to maintain sessions during scraping.
- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Automatically checks and obeys website rules defined in the `robots.txt` file.
- **Modular Structure**: Easily extendable and maintainable codebase for future enhancements.
