### `logger.py`
"""
 The `logger.py` module is responsible for logging various events in the application, such as requests made, responses received, errors encountered, and important milestones in the scraping process. This helps with debugging and monitoring the application's performance.

 **Example Implementation:**

```python
import logging

def setup_logger():
    logging.basicConfig(
        filename='scraper.log',
        level=logging.INFO,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    )

def log_request(url):
    logging.info(f'Requesting URL: {url}')

def log_response(url, status_code):
    logging.info(f'Response from {url}: {status_code}')

def log_error(url, error_message):
    logging.error(f'Error for URL {url}: {error_message}')
